# Caligrafo
Python Library with Text and Printing Tools

### The Idea
Work with alignments for texts, essentially when printing at terminal.
The same functions to align and stylize the printed text can be used to write into text files.
It will can support lists, tables, and some others text structuresâ€¦ ðŸ¤”
Iâ€™d like to use many blocks of text in the same page, maybe with overlaps, it would be coolâ€¦

The goal is to turn simple text formatting easier, allowing us to make more fancy CLIs and text files quickly.
